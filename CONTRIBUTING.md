# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Contributions are welcome, but they must be deliberate, respectful, and useful.

By participating in this project, you agree to follow the Code of Conduct and these guidelines.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

* Reporting bugs
* Proposing features or improvements
* Submitting pull requests
* Improving documentation
* Reviewing code and discussions

Low effort contributions that add noise rather than value may be declined.

## Before You Start

Before opening an issue or pull request:

* Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates
* Make sure your contribution aligns with the project’s goals
* Read the documentation and existing code

If you are unsure, open a discussion first. Guessing is inefficient.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, include:

* A clear and concise description
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Expected behavior vs actual behavior
* Relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages
* The affected version

Incomplete bug reports may be closed without action.

Security vulnerabilities must **not** be reported publicly. Follow the instructions in `SECURITY.md`.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests should:

* Solve a real problem
* Be consistent with the project’s scope
* Avoid unnecessary complexity

Not every idea needs to exist. Well argued ideas have better odds.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests must:

* Be focused on a single change
* Include tests when applicable
* Pass existing tests and checks
* Follow the project’s coding style
* Avoid introducing breaking changes without discussion

Large or invasive changes should be discussed before implementation.

## Code Quality

All contributions should:

* Be readable and maintainable
* Avoid unnecessary abstractions
* Prefer clarity over cleverness
* Not introduce security risks

If your code is hard to understand, it will not be merged.

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Avoid vague messages like “fix stuff” or “update”.

Good commits explain **why**, not just **what**.

## Review Process

All contributions are reviewed by maintainers. Feedback is part of the process.

Maintainers may:

* Request changes
* Ask for clarification
* Reject contributions that do not meet project standards

Decisions are final. This is not a democracy.

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project’s existing license.

If you do not agree with the license, do not contribute.

## Abuse and Misuse

Contributions that intentionally add malicious behavior, backdoors, tracking, or insecure patterns will be rejected and may result in a permanent ban from the project.

Suspected abuse should be reported privately as described in `SECURITY.md`.

## Final Notes

The goal of this project is quality, safety, and reliability.

If you are here to learn, collaborate, and build responsibly, you are welcome.

If you are here to cause problems, you will be shown the exit.
